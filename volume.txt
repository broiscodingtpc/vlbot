Project Plan: Solana Volume Trading Simulator

1. Goal

To mathematically prove and simulate the concept of generating high notional trading volume (e.g., $10,000 - $33,000+) using a small revolving capital pool (e.g., $100) on a low-fee decentralized exchange (DEX) environment like Solana.

2. Technical Stack (Simulation)

Language: Python (for simple scripting and mathematical clarity)

Libraries: Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies needed)

3. Financial Assumptions (The Model)

This simulation uses the following fixed variables derived from typical Solana DEX fee structures:

Parameter

Value

Description

Initial Capital

$100.00 USD

The starting balance of the fund.

DEX Trading Fee

0.10% (0.001)

Fee taken by the DEX/Pool per transaction side (Buy or Sell).

Total Round-Trip Fee

0.20% (0.002)

The total percentage loss per Buy + Sell cycle.

Fixed Transaction Fee

$0.002 USD

Estimated cost in SOL (converted to USD) for one full round-trip (Buy + Sell, including priority fees).

The goal is to show how many round-trip trades can be executed before the revolving capital is consumed by these fees.

4. Core Logic / Algorithm (Simulation Loop)

The bot operates in a simple loop:

Check Capital: Ensure current_capital is greater than the trade size.

Determine Trade Size: Use the maximum available current_capital.

Execute Buy: Trade capital for Token X.

Volume Added: capital

Fee Loss: capital * DEX_fee

Execute Sell: Trade Token X back for the original token.

Volume Added: capital

Fee Loss: capital * DEX_fee

Total Cost Calculation:

Total Loss = (Volume * Total Round-Trip Fee) + Fixed Transaction Fee

Update State:

current_capital = current_capital - Total Loss

total_volume = total_volume + (2 * capital)

The loop repeats until the capital is insufficient for another trade, demonstrating the decay curve and the final volume achieved.
